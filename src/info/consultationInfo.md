Here is some important information about the consultation:
- The consultation is free
- There is a chance the consultation will overlap with a lesson. This is so you can observe the teaching process and decide if my style of teaching is right for you.
- If your consultation time overlaps with a lesson, you may stay up to 15 minutes after the lesson to ask all of your questions. The lesson lengths are 45 minutes so you will have a whole hour on the call.
- Zoom links will be sent out before the meeting on the day-of.
- Guests are allowed.
- If the prospective student is under 18, they MUST bring an adult family member to the consultation.
