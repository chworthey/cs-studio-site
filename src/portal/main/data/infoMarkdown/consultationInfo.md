- Consultation calls can be up to an hour long.
- The first 45 minutes overlap with a lesson time so that you can watch the lesson.
- The last 15 minutes are just for us to talk.
- If there are no students slotted for the scheduled time, it will just be us with no lesson to watch.
- The consultation is free. Woohoo!
- If the prospective student is under 18, an adult family member must be present in the call.
