# Policies

## Student Projects
1. Create projects within an artist's mindset. Push artistic boundaries but don't push content that is too obscene for all the parties involved.
2. Instructor is the arbitrator on team arguments and what is deemed fair

## Student Eligibility
1. I teach students 9 and up only
2. All students must already be equipped with a computer, and that computer's hardware must meet the requirements for the student's projects. Most computers work for most software projects. Making games or training AI models requires gaming hardware in addition. Group projects must be done with a common operating system or must be made cross-platform so that all the team members can contribute. Good to know: The instructor doesn't have a Mac so using a Mac is not recommended. Let me know if you ever need assistance with any of this, I'm happy to help.

## Money-related Rules
1. Pay for class on the day of
2. NO refunds or reschedules for missing a class for any reason. No refunds in general unless the instructor charged the customer by accident.
3. If the instructor needs to cancel a class, then money is not owed by the customer for that class.
4. The instructor may refuse service to any customer at any time (but won't refuse service because of characteristics such as religion, race and sexual orientation or anything like that).
5. The customer is responsible and liable for monitoring costs on project-related subscription and on-demand services (these project-related purchases are totally optional). Most things in software dev are free or very cheap, but some select projects may require multi-media tools that aren't considered cheap such as an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. When a project includes cloud services from Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud, then great attention and care must be taken on the administrative side of things. Cloud platforms like these demand a tight control of costs on individual project resources and those resources can add up if not kept in check. Customer account holders (hey, parents!) may need to take a class with me on cloud administration to make projects based on cloud technologies safely.

## Student Conduct
1. Treat your peers with a learning-teaching mindset and be patient and respectful of all differences in skill levels and age.
2. Try your best to be respectful and aware of boundaries anyone else might have.
