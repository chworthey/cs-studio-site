My method of teaching comes from practical experience working with middle school students, high school students, college students, and industry professionals.

I also grew up in a 2nd-generation teaching family. Teaching is in my blood, one could say!

## Group Lesson Structure

Each group class consists of 3-5 similarly-aged students.

It's inevitable there will be a skill gap between group members, but this is okay because this is also true when you're out there working in the real world. A great way to learn is to teach, and one of the main reasons this is group lessons and not private 1:1 lessons is to give you space to do exactly that. It's not only economical, it's necessary.

The group work will also give us an opportunity to get familiar with using industry-standard tooling for team projects, namely source control and project management software.

## Project-Based

Each group class will also have a project referred to as the **learning group project**.

The learning group project is shared between all of the students in that group. When a new student joins, an entirely new project must be created in order to accommodate them. For some of you, letting go of a previously-existing project may be challenging, but remember that the objective here is to learn as a group in an inclusive manner.

Working through project phases repeatedly is good to practice as well. Choosing projects of fitting length will become more natural to you as time goes on.

## Self-Reliance First

Programming languages and popular frameworks are almost like fashion statements in a constantly evolving industry. To keep up with the trends, you will need to learn how to learn new things on your own. I will not teach you everything you need to know in every instance. This will help you become independent. There will be space for you to learn from each other and from the vast wealth of information that the internet represents.

The services I provide are to keep you on-track at a higher level, aligned with your goals and with an understanding of how someone in the industry might view your project at all stages of development. I am also here to spark discussions that will challenge you.

## Philosophical Rabbit Holes

Software engineers seem to be able to materialize software programs from thin air. However, the act of doing so requires rigorous questioning of the Universe. At times it's possible to get sucked into an unforeseen rabbit hole.

For example: **The Ship of Theseus problem**. Say there is a ship. If, after hundreds of years of maintenance on that ship, and each component of the ship was replaced individually, can you then really call it the same ship? Sometimes in software, we need to have an answer for these things even when there are many stances one could take.

What if the ship was instead a personal computer, and the user plugs in a mouse adding a new hardware device. Is that now the same computer? This is a particularly important topic when you talk about operating system licensing which relies on a license being attached to a particular device. Quite a conundrum!

Being side-tracked by a philosophical maze while writing software is far more common than one would think. In fact, when one asks even the simplest questions, that is when you are most bound to be humbled. It may be difficult at times to communicate to your stakeholders why you are unable to fulfill their request. Imagine being told by your boss to set up license checks on an operating system, only to retort with the Ship of Theseus? That is what a software developer might do. And as a person responsible for that software project, this is only the beginning of where the challenges are.

## Challenges of Software Development

There are many challenges of software development that arise from philosophical rabbit holes and other forms of churn that even senior practitioners struggle with. These challenges are:

- Predicting task length and project length
- Understanding where certain overarching tasks begin and end
- Valuating the positive and negative impacts of any one part of the software
- Valuating the positive and negative impacts of architectural decisions throughout the project lifetime
- Maintaining and organizing important documentation for knowledge-transfer
- Communicating the internals of a project to stakeholders to keep departments aligned
- Maintaining work-life balance in the face of tight deadlines
- Underestimating the challenges of a software project, especially if you're not an experienced developer
- Resourcing different departments correctly so that they have the capacity to assist one another where needed
- Balancing competing interests and minimizing context-switching

School, coding bootcamps, and online courses cannot adequately teach you how to deal with any of these challenges. The only thing that can teach you how to deal with them is experience itself. My role as teacher in the face of these challenges will be to ensure that your learning environment closely matches that of the working world so that the experience you gain will translate to the working world more directly than other educational programs would.

## Choosing a Career

See [Career Overview](/career) for more information.

## Neuro-Diversity Awareness

I strive to meet students where their needs are at. Oftentimes, this means challenging students in ways that traditional schooling cannot. I myself am transgender, with AuDHD, but I didn't know any of that until a few years ago. I was considered "gifted" when I was growing up. People like me, and I know there are a handful in every school, have special needs. My services are designed to close the gap on those needs so students can get a suitable education that propels them confidently into the working world.

## Hackathons

Hackathons are a bit of a tradition these days in the tech world. The format of a hackathon may vary, but it's typically about getting everyone together working on projects they've never done before, and these hackathons usually last a day or more.

The hackathons I host are non-competitive and happen twice a year, once in November, and once in April. Every team will have a chance to present their hackathon projects at the end. There are other hackathons going on too throughout the year, I will do my best to keep students informed of those.

We will be getting local employers involved with our hackathons, so this will be the time to get on their radar if you're looking for work. I myself got noticed by my first employer after doing well at a hackathon. Participating in one always looks great on a resume.
