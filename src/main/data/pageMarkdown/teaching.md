# Learning Software Engineering

## What to Expect

## Understanding Motivation

## Projects Based in Reality

No line of code was ever written by someone who knew what they were doing. The code one writes seems to have a life of its own. The code can produce bugs and other unintended consequences. The code is replicated across space and time and even other code using the same mechanics as written language. Code can change our relationship to time, making things that were slow so much more faster when we run it on our devices. When code makes it into our stock market, our housing market, our grocery store, we have a tendency to feel like code ran away from us, like there is no time for us anymore. Code can change our relationship to our own consciousness and the ways in which we relate to one another and exchange information. It can get in our heads, make us addicted to things, cause us to isolate, and even be a dubious nanny. It can also teach and coordinate social groups and create new worlds and new ways to express oneself.

At the time of this writing (year 2024), general-purpose computers are themselves 79 years old, the first one being the ENIAC in 1945. The first personal computer was created in 1974, the Altair 8800, only 50 years ago. I have been alive for most of this time. I consider myself to be one of the first humans to have access to a functional internet during my early childhood. I wrote my first line of code before the launch of Stack Overflow, the most popular software engineer Q&A website.

The role of a software engineer is to take a vague ask and materialize the spirit of the ask in a replicable manner through a rigorous line of questioning. Each line of code is an imperfect response to one of these questions, and projects often have millions of these responses represented in their source code for any given version. Despite the confidence a software engineer may outwardly project, managing a software project comes with certain challenges that are challenging even for the most senior of practitioners.

Challenges of a managing a software project:
- Predicting task length and project length
- Understanding where certain overarching tasks begin and end
- Valuating the positive and negative impacts of any one part of the software
- Valuating the positive and negative impacts of architectural decisions throughout the project lifetime
- Maintaining and organizing important documentation for knowledge-transfer
- Communicating the internals of a project to stakeholders and keep departments aligned
- Shifting gears mid-project and meeting a different set of project criteria within a short time frame
- Maintaining work-life balance in the face of a tight deadline
- Underestimating the challenges of a software project, especially if you're not a developer

School, coding bootcamps, and online courses cannot adequately teach you how to deal with any of these challenges. The only thing that can teach you how to deal with them is experience itself. My role as teacher will be to ensure that your learning environment closely matches that of the working world so that the experience you gain will translate to the working world more directly than other educational programs would.
