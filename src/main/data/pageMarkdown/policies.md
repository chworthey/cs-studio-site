## Class Structure
1. Classes consist of 3-5 students.
2. Classes are 45 minutes, remote over a Zoom call.
3. In-Person special events are generally based in Littleton, CO.
4. New prospective students may at times join classes 
5. Groups will consist of students of similar ages.
6. Prospective students may sit-in on a class for their initial consultations. Prospective students will stay on 15 minutes after the class ends.

## Student Projects
1. Projects are shared between all students of a group class.
2. Each time a new member joins a group, a new project must be created to accommodate the new team member.
3. Group projects must be done with a common operating system or must be made cross-platform so that all the team members can contribute. Good to know: The instructor doesn't have a Mac so using a Mac is not recommended. Let me know if you ever need assistance with any of this, I'm happy to help.

## Student Eligibility
1. I do not teach children below the age of 13.
2. All students must be self-equipped with a computer, and that computer's hardware must meet the requirements for the student's projects. Most computers work for most software projects. Making games or training AI models requires gaming hardware in addition.

## Money-related Rules
1. Each class costs $32 per student
2. For now, we are using Cash-App to pay
3. Pay for class on the day of or before, 3-strike rule
4. NO refunds or reschedules for a student missing a class for any reason. The exception would be if the instructor charged the customer by accident.
5. If the instructor needs to cancel a class, then money is not owed by the customer for that class.
6. The instructor has the right to fire students, refusing service
7. The customer is responsible and liable for monitoring costs on project-related subscription and on-demand services. Most things in software dev are free or very cheap, but some select projects may require tools that aren't considered cheap such as an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Students may opt to avoid projects that require these tools altogether.

## Student Conduct
1. Treat your peers with a learning-teaching mindset and be patient and respectful of all differences in ability levels and age.
2. Try your best to be respectful and aware of boundaries anyone else might have.
3. No disruptive behavior
