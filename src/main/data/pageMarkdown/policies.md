## Class Structure
1. Classes consist of 3-5 students.
2. Classes are 45 minutes, remote over a Zoom call.
3. In-Person special events are generally based in Westminster, CO. **You do not need to live in Westminster, CO to be a student here.** Hackathons may be attended remotely.
4. Groups will consist of students of similar ages.
5. Prospective students may sit-in on a class for their initial consultations. Prospective students will stay on 15 minutes after the class ends.

## Student Projects
1. Projects are shared between all students of a group class.
2. Each time a new member joins a group, a new project must be created to accommodate the new team member.
3. Group projects must be done with a common operating system or must be made cross-platform so that all the team members can contribute. Good to know: The instructor doesn't have a Mac so using a Mac is not recommended. Let me know if you ever need assistance with any of this, I'm happy to help.

## Student Eligibility
1. I do not teach children below the age of 13.
2. I do not teach students who live outside of the United States. This is mainly because I am unfamiliar with the international tax landscape.
3. All students must be self-equipped with an internet-connected computer, and that computer's hardware must meet the requirements for the student's projects. Most computers work for most software projects. Making games or training AI models requires gaming hardware in addition.

## Money-related Rules
1. Each class costs $32 per student
2. For now, we are using [Cash App](https://cash.app/) for lesson payments
3. Pay for class on the day of or before, 3-strike rule
4. NO refunds or reschedules for a student missing a class for any reason. The exception would be if the instructor charged the customer by accident.
5. If the instructor needs to cancel a class, then money is not owed by the customer for that class.
6. The instructor has the right to fire students, refusing service
7. The customer is responsible and liable for monitoring costs on project-related subscription and on-demand services. Most things in software dev are free or very cheap, but some select projects may require tools that aren't considered cheap such as an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Students may opt to avoid projects that require these tools altogether.

## Student Conduct
1. Treat your peers with a learning-teaching mindset and be patient and respectful of all differences in ability levels and age.
2. Try your best to be respectful and aware of boundaries anyone else might have.
3. No disruptive behavior
4. Camera- on! Please have a working camera and a quality microphone.

## Instructor Contact
1. I, Charlotte Worthey, am typically available for any questions by email. I encourage my students to reach out when they have questions about anything. I typically process my email inbox once per weekday.
2. My contact information will not be revealed on this public-facing website. If you don't have my contact information, you may send a message through the [website portal here](/portal).
3. My phone number is only for on-boarding and off-boarding students or student emergencies (such as being locked out of a building during a hackathon). For all other uses, including missing a lesson, please use email to contact me.
4. For adult 18+ students only, we have a Discord group. I will be active there as well and can answer non-sensitive questions there on the text/voice channels.
