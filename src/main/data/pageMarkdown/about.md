## The trail I have blazed...

As a young [zillenial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillennials) born in the United States from a middle-class family, a huge gift I was given at a formative age was a computer with internet access.

I spent many of my childhood years building imaginative digital worlds with the scrappy resources I had at my disposal. Some of those resources were, believe it or not, books! I was frequently the tech-support resource for my family.

My years at University were mixed. I was considered to be a star student when I entered and was hired as a summer intern. However, after my internship, I completely lost focus in my classes and stopped attending them altogether. There was also something else going on medically but I didn't understand this until much later. I never got my degree.

With stars in my eyes and student loans mounting, I made the fateful decision to leave university. I built up an online portfolio and succeeded in getting a job seemingly against all odds. The job I got was at a company that contracted out workers to Microsoft. It was *kind of* like working at Microsoft because we got to work in the Xbox headquarters, a few desks away from Phil Spencer himself, the head of Xbox, an idol of mine. At the same time, the working environment was questionable. We'd get an orange-colored badge instead of a blue-colored badge. We weren't invited to many of the catered events and parties. The project deadlines were tight. The job benefits were 2nd-class. There was red tape everywhere!

I found some relief when I jumped off the publishing arm and landed on the new Minecraft data team. I was their first dedicated engineering resource!

Again with that medical condition though- something didn't feel right, and dark clouds surrounded me once more. I felt a strange pull for novelty. "I have everything I ever wanted. Why am I still unhappy?" I asked myself. I decided to leave for Thailand, a place I knew next to nothing about. With the blessing of my contract managers (and US contract law), I sold all of my things, strapped on a backpack, and set off!

Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, South Korea, Japan, Sweden! I felt like the luckiest human on earth. I made more money doing that than I would have made had I stayed in Bellevue, Washington. After my time abroad, I quit my job to hike 760 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from Canada alllll the way across Washington State and half of Oregon. Uhm, yes! This was fun. A little dangerous, but fun.

During Covid I was rehired by the Minecraft data team but this time as an employee proper! After years of being nomadic, I wanted to settle down somewhere and at least build myself an "HQ". I picked North Bend, a town that was about an hour drive from Redmond (in the mountains!) so I could work in the offices once more. But being in the Seattle area is like treading water. The income might be stellar, but the rent is high too. Being able to afford a house even with 6-figure income seemed like a difficult task. What I didn't know, however, is that I was soon to crash and burn.

Yes, burnout took center-stage during my last few years at Microsoft. It looked something like [this video](https://youtu.be/ia8Q51ouA_s). I finally had to face my declining health and leave for good. Since then, I've been diagnosed with ADHD. After all of that! I'm also suspected to be on the spectrum as well by many of my friends who are autistic (there is a lot of overlap between the two conditions I might add). There were other contributing factors to the burnout as well but they were mainly large-scale societal issues and there weren't many individual people one could point a finger to and say "hey, it's your fault" other than myself.

So, listen! I want you to learn from my successes and my failures. That's why I built this program for y'all. There is a lot of information in this head of mine that can help you. Carving a path in this day and age is perplexing! Tech layoffs seem to be happening everywhere, burnout also seems to be widely spread. AI... well it mixes things up a little but try not to worry about AI... I'm here to help you make sense of all of it and find safe passage. Every other kid wants to be a game developer. For most of the kids who enter my classes, turning away from the career is that safe passage. Join my class to find out why.

But if you stick around, we can get you into a creative engineering mindset. You can bring that mindset anywhere, even other disciplines. Especially other disciplines! I encourage students to let their interdisciplinary knowledge shine when working on their projects. These projects always have stories that stand out. Stories like these are the best tool to advocate for oneself out there in the world as you pivot from one thing to the next.

I was a game developer, and now I'm a teacher. This is my story.

## Where did the teaching idea come from?

When I was in High School, I founded a club called "The Game Creation Club". We made a 2D platformer game in C# using the XNA Framework. We didn't really have knowledgeable staff on-hand so I was the closest thing to it and I really enjoyed exchanging knowledge with the club members.

Later, a group of the regular club members and I splintered off to form *Friday Game Studios*. On Fridays, we would gather together after school to give each other status updates, swap files, learn new game dev tricks, and then, of course, play Call of Duty late into the night when we were finished!

The Friday Game Studios project was pretty ambitious. We wanted to make an RPG set in a gladiatorial training school that was based in 3D fantasy world. I took on the responsibility of making the game engine for the project. At the time, Unreal Development Kit (Unreal Engine 3) existed but we didn't elect to use it because it was so new. Making a game with a generalized game engine wasn't that much of a thing.

Our engine featured:
- Menu UI
- Blender-to-game data tooling (for things like placing lights and spawn locations in addition to the 3D level meshes)
- Skinned animations for characters
- First-person camera
- Split-screen multiplayer
- Game-pad support
- Particle effects for torch flames
- Lens flares
- Bloom post processing
- Deferred shading with real-time lighting
- Diffuse, Specular, Ambient Occlusion, Normal maps
- Level loading/unloading
- NPC branching dialog and our own conversation editor tool
- Nav-mesh for PC/NPC level navigation
- Oriented hitbox collision, the beginning of a combat system

Our art pipeline was pretty extensive too.

Our art featured:
- Concept art
- Several different combat arenas
- Several connected levels of the gladiatorial school, with indoor and outdoor areas
- Many different characters with textures derived from model photo shoots we bought
- The game logo
- An intro cinematic
- Several ranged/melee weapons and clothing items- many of them creative!
- Animated cards of people cheering to be placed in the arena stands
- Motion capture animations from experimental video-based pose-estimation algorithms (cameras were set up in one of our basements)
- Self-made music, some of it featuring guitar!
- Very entertaining voice dialog from many of our classmates
- A freaking documentary of ourselves that I will share with no one

You get the idea!

We never finished the project, nor could we. But all of the stuff I mentioned above, we did. I don't regret trying at all. I mean... a motion capture studio? Come on! How cool is that? And all before college too! Later on, we learned to tailor the projects to our abilities, of course.

Now THIS is how you learn.

Why don't they teach it like this? Well, college courses do have group projects sometimes but they usually need to fit a particular set of learning outcomes and within a semester time-frame. There's often a disconnect too, many of people teaching might come from an academic-only background and may view group projects through an academic lens which may not align with what it's actually like in the industry.

Here, we have the freedom to break the rules together and do whatever we want while still being challenged along the way. We will also keep you aligned with the trends of the software industry.

If I had a teacher when I was working on my earlier projects, the following would apply:
- I would have had an easier time adjusting to the industry workflows
- I would have had fewer code-smells and anti-patterns when I entered the industry
- I would have been more informed of tooling choices and industry trends
- I would have been able to budget time better
- I would have had the right language to communicate with management and other team members
- I would have pronounced words correctly
- I would have understood how other people view my code
- I would have been more aware of design patterns
- I would have made use of test-driven development
- I would have used source control earlier
- I would have been more aware of certain performance considerations
- I would have managed projects more efficiently
- I would have felt rewarded for my progress rather than the end result
- I would have had better information and tools for work-life balance
- I would have been more aware of the implications of neurodiversity
- I would have been more aware of accessibility concerns
- I would have adjusted my documentation strategy
- I would have had better support in general

If you have me as a teacher, none of this is going to happen to you! I've got your back. :)
