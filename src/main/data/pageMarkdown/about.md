Hello, my name is Charlotte Worthey. I use she/her/hers pronouns, and I'm based in Westminster, Colorado.

I am a Software Engineer and Data Engineer with 17 years of software development excellence and multiple top-selling video game title credits.

Thanks to the internet, knowledge has never been more accessible to those that have the motivation to obtain it. However, learning in a vacuum without feedback can lead to problems: reinforcement of maladjusted practices, over-reliance on products that have known limitations, and lack of team experiences.

Over-reliance on university degrees and certification programs also lead to problems: students are often disconnected from the reality that self-learning is an important part of the job, the cost is arguably too high, and the studentâ€“teacher ratio is unfavorable for the students.

I see a need for an education tier that provides a middle path. This is a path where portfolios and professional development are the prime focus. It's supplementary towards the other learning paths, and provides a unique opportunity for those that need individualized mentorship. The class sizes are a 3-5. I seek to foster an experience that reflects the working world as closely as possible while supporting individual student needs. I feel that for the right students, this approach is a better fit than something more rigid and structured (like a bootcamp, for example).

Worthey Studios, in summary, is the educational opportunity I wish I had.

If you would like to learn more about me and my work, check out my [portfolio here](/portfolio). This is also an example of a portfolio my students would be making for themselves.

Here are a few key things to notice about the portfolio:
- Learnings from the featured projects are highlighted.
- Only some of the projects are completed, and that's okay.
- The portfolio is detailed, but brief. There is more on GitHub that readers may dive into should they wish to.

Please feel free check out the rest of the site too!
