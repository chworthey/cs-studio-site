Hello, my name is Charlotte Worthey. I use she/her/hers pronouns, and I'm based in Westminster, Colorado.

I am a Software Engineer and Data Engineer with 17 years of software development excellence and multiple top-selling video game title credits. I have worked on the Minecraft, Crackdown, Age of Empires, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, and Forza franchises.

Thanks to the internet, knowledge has never been more accessible to those that have the motivation to obtain it. However, learning in a vacuum without feedback can lead to problems: reinforcement of maladjusted practices, over-reliance on products that have known limitations, and lack of team experiences.

Over-reliance on university degrees and certification programs also lead to problems: students are often disconnected from the reality that self-learning is an important part of the job, the cost is arguably too high, and the student–teacher ratio is unfavorable for the students.

I see a need for an education tier that provides a middle path. This is a path where portfolios and professional development are the prime focus. It's supplementary towards the other learning paths, and provides a unique opportunity for those that need individualized mentorship. The class sizes are a 3-5. I seek to foster an experience that reflects the working world as closely as possible while supporting individual student needs. I feel that for the right students, this approach is a better fit than something more rigid and structured (like a bootcamp, for example).

Worthey Studios, in summary, is the educational opportunity I wish I had.
