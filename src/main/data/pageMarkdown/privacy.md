I do not use/store cookies on this site.

I do not collect your data on this site unless you are explicitly prompted first.

The only place I prompt for information is in the portal, when you sign up for lessons or reach out for contact.

That would make me a data controller in this particular instance, I suppose. [That's a thing.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controllerprocessor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en)

The purpose of collecting the data is for me to further correspond with you.

I only collect the data that I need to do so.

If you use your browser's developer tools, chances are that you can look at your web requests to validate all of this.

The categories of data I collect pertain to the data you enter: Your name, your phone number, your age range, the time you would like to schedule a consultation for, the text that you input.

I do not teach students below the age 13, and minors need to have their parents' permission. The portal sign up & contact functions is intended for use by parents, not minors.

If you want to know more about the data you have sent me, we can discuss it, but you probably wouldn't learn much. I use Microsoft and Google services (Azure and Gmail, respectively) to process it.

If you don't have my contact information, you may reach me through a message in the [portal](/portal).

I'm currently a sole proprietorship and I'm not registered as a business if that's at all important to you.

I'll delete your data within 30 days if you ask me to.

I'll give it to you in JSON format within 30 days if you want me to, that makes it portable.

You may consider this legally binding if you feel sufficiently qualified to.

## Teaching Moment

It might seem interesting to you that I choose to not prompt you for cookie settings and don't follow the usual wall of text.

So why does everybody else do it? Well...

The most common reason is that they don't know themselves and everybody else does it, so they do it to look more "official". They use website builders and things of the sort that add those features for them, and website users get accustomed to those features. But, once your company gets to a certain size (large), that's when these things actually become important.

Let's discuss some law! Disclaimer: I'm not a legal expert.

## GDPR & State Legislation

GDPR stands for *General Data Protection Regulation*, and it's a regulation that particularly protects people in the EU. Here are the rights it promises:
1. The right to be informed
2. The right of access
3. The right to rectification
4. The right to erasure
5. The right to restrict processing
6. The right to data portability
7. The right to object
8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling

It boils down to these principles:
- You need to be informed about data collection
- You need to be able to request a copy of your data and understand how it is being processed
- You can correct inaccurate personal data about yourself
- You can request deletion of your data, you can be forgotten about
- The copy of the data you receive must be structured/machine-readable
- You may refuse the collection of your personal data
- You have the right to not be subject to adverse automated decision making if it significantly affects you under some circumstances

The penalties for a company to severely fail a GDPR implementation are up to €20 million, or 4% of the firm's worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher. For a large software corps, this equates to billions of dollars. [Read about what happened to Facebook / Meta](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en).

At the same time, this is just in the EU. Right? Well... Not anymore.

Protections in the EU tend to precede protections elsewhere, so large US-based companies began to provide the same rights to US users even though, at the time, there were no such protections in the US. I applauded this, it seemed ethical.

But then this happened: after the large companies started implementing this, users got used to it. At that point, it became all about the optics: "Does our site have that thing yet? No? Well that makes us look bad!"

But, because the smaller companies didn't have the resources to implement it themselves, they outsourced it, and that's how we got it everywhere.

With privacy protections entering the public consciousness, states began to look at privacy laws to follow in EU's footsteps.

At the time of writing, we now have data privacy legislation in these states:
- California
- Colorado
- Connecticut
- Delaware
- Florida
- Indiana
- Iowa
- Kentucky
- Maryland
- Minnesota
- Montana
- New Hampshire
- Nebraska
- New Jersey
- Oregon
- Rhode Island
- Tennessee
- Texas
- Utah
- Virginia
- Maine
- Michigan
- Nevada
- New York
- Vermont
- Washington

In the state of Colorado for example, where I currently do all my business, has the [2021 Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) you can read about here](https://coag.gov/resources/colorado-privacy-act/).
