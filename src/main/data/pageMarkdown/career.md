Imagine what it was like to be a person born in another time with different technology. The only constant for technology has always been change.

## Human Computers

```
Do this.
Then this.
Then that.
Repeat the above 100 times.
```

A "computer" used to be the name of a human occupation. A human computer was given a rigid set of tasks to complete. Such tasks were used to calculate things like logarithmic tables or the positions of planets. Many human computers were utilized in World War I and World War II to produce referential material for many wartime operations.

## Programmable Computers

Then along came the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). That was less than 100 years ago, in the year of 1945.

## Personal Computers

The first commercially successful personal computer, the Altair 8800, came in the year 1974. That was only 50 years ago!

## AI in the 80s

Interest in AI applications is nothing new. In the year 1984, interest in AI from businesses had spiraled out of control. Sound familiar? Funding and interest was in decline, and this period of time became known as the first AI winter.

## The Dot Com Times

Later, the World Wide Web became available for public adoption in the year 1993. Many of my formative years were during this time. We saw a dot-com bubble peak during the year 2000. Subsequently, it crashed, leaving many programmers without work!

## Mobile Take-Over

Less than a decade after that, I remember seeing the announcement by Steve Jobs for the first iPhone in 2008. I was still a kid at the time, but I knew things were about to change in a big way Mobile phone adoption spread like wildfire around the world. Everyone wanted to make an app. Now, in the year of 2024, more than 60% of the world is connected to the internet because of this technology.

## Social Media

Facebook was already on the center-stage as a social media app when the mobile revolution was taking place. YouTube, existed. You probably know the rest.

## Gaming in Recent Years

Gaming consoles entered a phase of decline recently as graphics hardware became more accessible on other devices. Microsoft pivoted to services (for example, game pass) about the time I started working there in 2016.

## Cloud Services

In the early Dot Com days, start ups would host their own web servers and manage the server hardware themselves. Later, this was out-sourced to big tech because scaling was cumbersome to achieve. Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud has now cemented themselves as the backbone of the majority of the web. I use Microsoft Azure on this site! It costs me very little because I'm small-fry and intend to stay that way. That being said, if you are a student mine and you are interested in web, I will urge you to learn how to run a server yourself just in case. Writing cloud-native apps is totally a normal thing these days but it couples you to infrastructure that you cannot control the prices of which can bite you in the long run. These cloud services are amazing in the sense that they can handle your thing going viral, but your bank account might not feel the same way so it's important to keep that in mind.

## Data

Data became referred to as the "next oil". I myself worked as a data engineer on the #1 paid app on the Android and iOS marketplace, Minecraft! However, I did not work in the targeted advertising space where the sentiment of 'data as oil' seemed to come from.

## COVID

When COVID hit, many companies over-hired because they saw an opportunity to gain market leverage with the increased attention of their respective audiences. Now it seems we're in another cycle of layoffs and worker displacement.

## Silicon Valley

Globalization has caused much outsourcing to countries that have lower costs of living than the United States. Still, early formulations of companies need to take place somewhere, and in the United States, that somewhere has historically been Silicon Valley, where the dot com revolution took place. No big companies are looking to create their own products, generally speaking. More often, they are looking to buy out silicon-valley startups to increase their portfolios. The startups are often funded by investors looking to build a company to the phase of buy-out, where a large corporation can then take the reigns and provide cross-organizational support to the teams building the product when the product needs that support.

## When Technology Grows Teeth

WARNING: I mention suicide in this section.

Diaspora is an open-source Facebook-like user-owned social network originally made by a young group of students. After its initial release, the social network was co-opted by the militant group ISIS. Ilya Zhitomirsky, one of the founding developers, is no longer with us. The death of Ilya Zhitomirsky was formally ruled as suicide. Presumably, the stress the Diaspora project caused was among the contributing factors. I tell this story mainly to keep those interested in technology mindful about the possible unintended consequences of making any technology more available. The consequences themselves may be bad on their own, but it's important to note that the creators of these technologies may be psychologically burdened by the consequences as well and this is not something to be taken lightly from a health standpoint. If you walk the path of a technology creator or any kind of creator for that matter, it's important to make space for healing whenever a disruption like this occurs and to do your best to understand the impact of the things you make, ideally before you make them.

I am someone who has seen the butterfly effects of my own actions [reflected back to me culturally](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/in-minecraft), and thinking about this stuff is much more relevant than I ever would have thought.

Relevant Movie: [Dave Made a Maze](https://youtu.be/1m8N9sfxzDg)

This is a movie very near and dear to me that shows one's own creations growing teeth. Even though the movie is not directly related to the software development discipline, I imagine this movie would be relatable to many tech workers. I highly recommend you give this a watch at some point!

## Education Disruption

The internet brought about new opportunities to share and exchange knowledge. I learned coding primarily from internet resources although those resources weren't as complete and engaging as the ones that exist today. I did not have a dedicated mentor at the time which would have been helpful. However, the internet of that time was enough to make me feel more attuned to industry trends than those who were primarily relying on academic echo chambers.

I made the risky decision to drop out of college once I felt like I had a decent personal project portfolio. For me, it paid off because I didn't have a lot of money for tuition but I had a lot of drive to create. However, would I give that out as blanket advice for new students today? Honestly, not quite. Worthey Studios represents an experiment of mine to see if we can complete this cycle of disruption together and remove the risk from the equation.

The main target demographic here is pre-college students who might benefit from following their interests in software with the assistance of a teacher like me. While this project is still experimental at this time, I do see the value this might create, especially for gifted students. Gifted students are special-needs students and my services provide a way for these individuals to thrive in a way that is visible and desirable to potential employers regardless of degree-status.

If all goes as expected, some of my students will see interest from employers before being put into a financially risky situation. Other students of mine will find that they cannot picture themselves anywhere in the industry and this information will save them from doomed finances later on. In both of these scenarios I have outlined, students will have added value to their lives in a meaningful way at the end of this.

## Discussion

I want you to have a realistic understanding of what working the industry is like. Working full-time as a software engineer and sometimes with on-call duties is the status quo in the United States. Freelance/gig work is relatively more infrequent for software workers in the United States because of the outsourcing to places that have lower costs of living. For people with sensory needs like me, the status quo can be challenging. However, I was able to take advantage of the current situation by being willing to work from other countries while living as a digital-nomad. This could be a very exciting life and is something to consider! There are also many opportunities to work with agencies and you might even be able to form one yourself as well.

So where are we now? What is there to make of all of this?

Given all the past cycles of booms and busts, it's a risky venture to find your footing. Historically, we're still in the formative years of computation in general, and that's exciting! I think if you really want to become a software engineer, there is a place for you out there somewhere. It largely depends on you! What are your needs? What do you believe technology can do for others? How will you communicate that to others? What are you willing to do to get there? How will you respond when times get tough? What is the story that you want to tell?

In my classes I like to bring you through all of these questions and more. Being a software engineer is no longer just about designing, writing, and maintaining code. It's about harnessing your unique ability to manifest entire systems of ideas across many spaces and times and learning from that. Some of the greatest software engineers of our time don't hold the title of software engineer. Think outside of the box because nothing is as straight-forward as it may seem...
