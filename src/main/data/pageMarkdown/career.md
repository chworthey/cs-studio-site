Imagine what it was like to be a person born in another time with different technology. When it comes to technology, the only constant is change.

## Human Computers

```
Do this.
Then this.
Then that.
Repeat the above 100 times.
```

A "computer" used to be the name of a human occupation. A human computer was given a rigid set of tasks to complete. Such tasks were used to calculate things like logarithmic tables or the positions of planets. Many human computers were utilized in World War I and World War II to produce referential material for many wartime operations.

## Programmable Computers

Then along came the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). That was less than 100 years ago, in the year of 1945.

## Personal Computers

The first commercially successful personal computer, the Altair 8800, came in the year 1974. That was only 51 years ago!

## AI in the 80s

Interest in AI applications is nothing new. In the year 1984, interest in AI from businesses had spiraled out of control. Sound familiar? Funding and interest was in decline, and this period of time became known as the first AI winter.

## The Dot Com Times

Later, the World Wide Web became available for public adoption in the year 1993. Many of my formative years were during this time. We saw a dot-com bubble peak during the year 2000. Subsequently, it crashed, leaving many programmers without work!

## Mobile Take-Over

In 2008, Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone. I was still a kid at the time, but I knew things were about to change in a big way. Mobile phone adoption spread like wildfire around the world. Everyone wanted to make an app. Now, in the year of 2025, more than 60% of the world is connected to the internet in large-part due to this spread.

## Social Media

Facebook was already on the center-stage as a social media app when the mobile revolution was taking place. YouTube, existed. You probably know the rest.

## Cloud Services

In the early Dot Com days, start ups would host their own web servers and manage the server hardware themselves. Later, this was out-sourced to big tech because in-house service scaling became cumbersome for many to achieve. Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud has now cemented themselves as the backbone of the majority of the web. I use Microsoft Azure on this site!

If you are a student of mine and you are interested in web, I will urge you to learn how to run a server yourself just in case. Writing cloud-native apps is totally a normal thing these days but it couples you to infrastructure that you cannot control the prices of which can bite you in the long run. These cloud services are amazing in the sense that they can handle your thing going viral, but your bank account might not feel the same way so it's important to keep that in mind.

## Data

Data at some point became referred to as the "next oil". I myself worked as a data engineer on the #1 paid app on the Android and iOS marketplace, Minecraft! However, I did not work in the targeted advertising space where the sentiment of 'data as oil' seemed to come from.

## Silicon Valley

Globalization has caused much outsourcing to countries that have lower costs of living than the United States. Still, early formulations of companies need to take place somewhere, and in the United States, that somewhere has historically been Silicon Valley, where the dot com revolution took place.

More often than not, large companies are looking to buy out silicon-valley startups to increase their portfolios. The startups in Silicon Valley are often funded by investors looking to build a company to the phase of buy-out, where a large company can then take the reigns and provide cross-organizational support.

It's worth noting that some companies escape buy-out as well.

## Education Disruption

The internet brought about new opportunities to share and exchange knowledge. I learned coding primarily from internet resources although those resources weren't as complete and engaging as the ones that exist today. I did not have a dedicated mentor at the time which would have been helpful. However, the internet of that time was enough to make me feel more attuned to industry trends than those who were primarily relying on coursework.

I made the risky decision to drop out of college once I felt like I had a decent personal project portfolio. For me, it paid off because I didn't have a lot of money for tuition but I had a lot of drive to create. However, would I give that out as blanket advice for new students today? Honestly, not quite. Worthey Studios represents an experiment of mine to see if we can complete this cycle of disruption together and remove the risk from the equation.

The main target demographic here is pre-college students. If all goes as expected, some of my students will see interest from employers before being put into a financially risky situation. Other students of mine will find that they cannot picture themselves anywhere in the industry. From a finances perspective, this is very valuable information to know early. In both of these scenarios I have outlined, students will have gained valuable risk-minimizing information.

## Discussion

I want you to have a realistic understanding of what working the industry is like. Working full-time as a software engineer and sometimes with on-call duties is the status quo in the United States. Freelance/gig work is relatively more infrequent for software workers in the United States because of the outsourcing to places that have lower costs of living. I was able to take advantage of the current situation by being willing to work from other countries while living as a digital-nomad. This could be a very exciting life and is something to consider! There are also many opportunities to work with agencies and you might even be able to form one yourself as well at some point.

So where are we now? What is there to make of all of this?

Given all the past cycles of booms and busts, it's a risky venture to find your footing. Historically, we're still in the formative years of computation in general, and that's exciting! I think if you want to become a software engineer, there is a place for you out there somewhere. It largely depends on you! What are your needs? What do you believe technology can do for others? How will you communicate that to others? What are you willing to do to get there? How will you respond when times get tough? What is the story that you want to tell?

In my classes I like to bring you through all of these questions and more. Being a software engineer is no longer just about designing, writing, and maintaining code. It's about harnessing your unique ability to manifest entire systems of ideas across many spaces and times. Some of the greatest software engineers of our time don't hold the title of software engineer. Think outside of the box because nothing is as straight-forward as it may seem...
